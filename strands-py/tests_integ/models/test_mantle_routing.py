"""Drift detection for the hand-maintained Mantle base-path table (#3654).

Mantle serves each model from exactly one base path (``/v1`` or ``/openai/v1``), rejects
the other with HTTP 400, and exposes no API that reports the routing, so
:data:`strands.models._openai_bedrock._OPENAI_PATH_MODEL_PREFIXES` goes stale whenever Mantle
onboards a model. For every model in the live catalog, this test asserts that the
resolved path serves it, probing the other path only on failure to distinguish misrouted
from unserved ids. Only HTTP 200 and 400 count as answers; any other status is retried
and, if it persists, fails the test as undetermined. The integration-test retry policy
gives transient external-service failures one more sweep before they hold the gate.

Failure means the table needs updating, not that the SDK is broken for existing models.
