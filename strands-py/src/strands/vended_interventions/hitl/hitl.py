    Each prompt is serialized behind a ``threading.Lock`` so concurrent tool calls
    can't interleave their reads from a single stdin. The blocking ``input`` call is
    offloaded to a worker thread so the event loop keeps running while waiting. A
    plain ``threading.Lock`` (rather than ``asyncio.Lock``) is used deliberately: the
    same handler instance may be reused across agent invocations that each spin up
    their own event loop, and a threading lock is the only kind that spans them.

    A worker thread blocked on ``input`` cannot be cancelled, so if the agent run is
    cancelled or times out mid-prompt the thread stays parked until the user presses
    enter and the process won't exit cleanly. ``ask="stdio"`` is therefore meant for
    interactive CLI sessions, not for runs that may be cancelled out from under it.

                ``!`` to exclude specific tools from ``"*"`` (they still require
                approval). For example, ``["read_file", "list_dir"]`` lets only those
                two run freely, while ``["*", "!delete_file"]`` lets everything run
                freely except ``delete_file``.
            classifier: Determines how approval decisions are made for tools not in
                ``allowed_tools``. Omitted/None: all non-allowed tools require approval.
                ``True``: uses the built-in LLM risk classifier with defaults.
                ``LLMClassifierConfig``: built-in LLM classifier with custom settings.
                Custom callable: your own classification logic.
            enable_trust: When True, trust responses approve the tool AND remember it
                in ``agent.state`` for the rest of the session (won't ask again).
                Works in both interrupt/resume and inline ``ask`` modes. Negated
                tools (``!tool``) cannot be trusted. With a ``classifier``, trusting
                a tool disables argument-level risk classification for that tool name
                for the rest of the session. Defaults to False.
            evaluate_trust: Custom trust response validator. Defaults to accepting
                ``"t"``/``"trust"`` (case-insensitive). When this returns True, the
                tool is approved AND trusted for the session. Only evaluated when
                ``enable_trust`` is True.
            evaluate: Custom approval response validator. Defaults to accepting
                ``True``, ``"y"``/``"yes"`` (case-insensitive).
            ask: Controls how the human's response is collected. Omitted (default):
                uses interrupt/resume - agent pauses, caller resumes with response.
                ``"stdio"``: prompts via CLI stdin. Agent blocks inline until the
                human responds. Note that stdio mode runs a blocking ``input()`` in a
                worker thread that cannot be cancelled, so it is intended for
                interactive CLI use rather than runs that may be cancelled mid-prompt.
                Custom callable: your own (optionally async) prompt logic (Slack, web
                UI, etc.). Agent blocks inline. A custom ``ask`` should return a concrete
                response; returning ``None`` (e.g. a dismissed dialog) is treated as an
                explicit deny. If it raises, the exception propagates and aborts the run
                (fail-closed) -- catch and return a deny value inside your callback if you
                prefer to proceed on error.

        Note:
            ``name`` is a fixed class attribute, so at most one ``HumanInTheLoop`` can be
            registered per agent; layering two policies requires subclassing to rename.
