"""Iterative-refinement plugin for Strands agents.

Validates the agent's response after each invocation; if it doesn't satisfy
the goal, feeds validator feedback back as a user message and re-enters the
agent loop via ``AfterInvocationEvent.resume``. Loops until validation passes,
``max_attempts`` is reached, or ``timeout`` elapses.

Example:
    ```python
    from strands import Agent
    from strands.vended_plugins.goal import GoalLoop

    # Natural-language goal — judged by an internal Agent built from the host's model.
    concise = GoalLoop(
        goal="At most 3 sentences, accessible to a 10-year-old, no jargon.",
        max_attempts=3,
    )
    agent = Agent(plugins=[concise])
    agent("Explain how rainbows form.")
    print(concise.last_result(agent))
    ```

Example:
    ```python
    # Programmatic validator — pass a callable as `goal` to run your own check.
    def word_count_validator(response, agent):
        text = " ".join(
            block["text"] for block in response["content"] if "text" in block
        )
        words = len(text.split())
        if words <= 50:
            return True
        return {"passed": False, "feedback": f"Too long ({words} words). Cap at 50."}

    word_count = GoalLoop(goal=word_count_validator, max_attempts=5, timeout=30.0)
    ```
