"""Shell tool for executing commands through a sandbox.

Provides :func:`make_shell` (a factory for a stateless, sandbox-routed shell tool)
and :data:`shell` (the default instance that reads the sandbox from the agent at
call time). Each call runs in a fresh shell; state such as variables and the
working directory does not persist across calls.

The command runs in whichever shell the sandbox provides -- ``sh`` for the Docker
and local environments, the remote login shell over SSH -- so it must not rely on
shell-specific syntax.
