"""HTTP request tool for making raw HTTP calls to external APIs.

Provides :func:`make_http_request` (a factory that lets the tool operator
supply a custom HTTP client) and :data:`http_request` (a default instance).

The tool is a thin shim over ``httpx.AsyncClient``. It delegates all
networking to the client instance provided by the operator, giving full
control over transport configuration, authentication, proxies, timeouts,
redirects, and connection pooling.

The parent agent's cancel signal (``Agent._cancel_signal``) is propagated so
an in-flight fetch aborts when the agent is cancelled. Cancellation is
signalled with :class:`asyncio.CancelledError`.
