"""OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tracing.

Enables distributed tracing across MCP client-server boundaries. The client
side is handled with `inject_trace_context`, which `MCPClient` uses to merge
the current OpenTelemetry context into the `_meta` field of outgoing tool
calls through the public `meta` parameter of the official `mcp` package.

The server side covers MCP servers hosted in the same process. It extracts
client-injected context from incoming messages so server-side spans join the
client's trace. This requires patching private internals of the `mcp` package
and those internals are only stable within the 1.x line, so the patches are
gated to `mcp` 1.x. The `mcp` 2.x line propagates trace context natively.
