"""Snapshot-based session manager.

Persists an agent as a single versioned :class:`~strands.types._snapshot.Snapshot`
blob on each lifecycle event, mirroring the TypeScript SDK's ``SessionManager``:

- A mutable ``snapshot_latest`` is overwritten on each save, for crash/restart resume.
- Append-only immutable snapshots (time-ordered keys) are written when a ``snapshot_trigger``
  fires, enabling checkpointing — restore to any prior state, not just the latest.

The manager persists snapshots through the unified :class:`~strands.storage.storage.Storage`
primitive (``write``/``read``/``delete``/``list`` over byte blobs). It owns the key layout,
snapshot-id scheme, and serialization; the storage backend only moves bytes, so the same
``Storage`` instance can back sessions, memory, and other subsystems.

This is distinct from the older message-log session managers
(:class:`~strands.session.repository_session_manager.RepositorySessionManager` and its
subclasses), which persist each message individually. Snapshots capture the whole agent
in one atomic blob and are the recommended path for new agents.
