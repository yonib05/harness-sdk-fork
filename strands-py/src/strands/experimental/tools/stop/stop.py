"""Tool for gracefully ending the agent loop.

This tool is experimental and subject to change in future revisions without notice.

Provides :func:`make_stop` (a factory for customized stop tools) and :data:`stop`
(the default instance). The tool shims onto the SDK's existing loop-termination
primitive: it sets ``invocation_state["request_state"]["stop_event_loop"] = True``,
which the event loop already checks after tool execution
(see :mod:`strands.event_loop.event_loop`). The tool returns the model-supplied
message when one was given, or a default when the model passed ``None`` or an
empty string; the returned value becomes the tool result the model sees for
its stop request.

The Python event loop halts on this flag with ``stop_reason == "tool_use"`` and
the final ``AgentResult.message`` set to the model's tool-use assistant message
(the batch that included the stop call). The tool's returned string appears in
history as the corresponding ``toolResult``, not as a separate final assistant
turn. This differs from the TypeScript side, whose ``AfterToolsEvent.endTurn``
primitive synthesizes a new assistant message with the stop text and
``stopReason == "endTurn"``. Callers that need the stop text as the last
assistant message on Python should read it from the tool result on the final
message, or append it themselves.
