    to render the results.

    Attributes:
        max_entries: Maximum number of entries to retrieve and inject per model call. A store
            ranks by semantic similarity, which is not the same as contextual usefulness, so the
            default injects a small candidate set rather than betting on the top hit. Raising it
            improves recall at the cost of a larger prepend (context bloat); lower it for a
            tighter injection. With multiple stores, results are concatenated in
            store-registration order with no cross-store ranking, so this cap can favor entries
            from earlier-registered stores. Defaults to 5.

            empty string to skip injection for this call. A callback that raises fails open
            (injection is skipped). Defaults to an adaptive query: the latest user message's
            text on a user turn, otherwise the most recent assistant message's text (the
            previous step on an autonomous turn).
        format: Renders retrieved entries into the injected text. A callback that raises fails
            open (injection is skipped). Defaults to a ``<memory>`` XML block with one
            ``<entry>`` per result, carrying a ``source`` attribute naming the originating store
            (when known) so the model can attribute and weigh each memory. The default escapes
