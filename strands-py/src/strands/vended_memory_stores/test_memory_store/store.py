    """A :class:`~strands.memory.types.MemoryStore` backed by a local JSON file.

    A zero-infrastructure store for prototyping and testing. It persists to disk by default so memories persist
    across sessions. Set ``persist=False`` for an ephemeral, single-session store.

    Recall is lexical: results are ranked by how many query tokens overlap an entry's content, with
    the most recent entry winning ties. This is keyword matching, not the semantic search a managed
    vector store (e.g. :class:`~strands.vended_memory_stores.bedrock_knowledge_base.BedrockKnowledgeBaseStore`)
    provides.

    Each :meth:`add` rewrites the whole file, so this fits modest volumes (hundreds to low thousands
    of entries), not production workloads — use a managed store like ``BedrockKnowledgeBaseStore`` for
    that. Writes within one event loop are serialized; concurrent writers across processes are not.

    Persistence is backed by the unified :class:`~strands.storage.Storage` interface internally:
    ``persist=True`` (the default) uses a :class:`~strands.storage.LocalFileStorage`, ``persist=False``
    an ephemeral :class:`~strands.storage.InMemoryStorage`. Unlike other subsystems
    (SnapshotSessionManager, ContextOffloader), this store does not accept an external ``Storage``
    or resolve from the agent-level ``storage`` — it manages its own backend via ``persist`` and
    ``path``.

    The on-disk format is shared with the TypeScript SDK's ``TestMemoryStore``: records use the same
    camelCase keys (``id``, ``content``, ``metadata``, ``createdAt``) and the same timestamp shape, so
    a backing file written by either SDK can be read by the other.

    Example:
        ```python
        from strands.vended_memory_stores.test_memory_store import TestMemoryStore

        # Persists to ~/.strands/memory/notes.json by default.
        store = TestMemoryStore(name="notes")

        result = await store.add("User prefers dark mode")
        results = await store.search("what theme does the user like?")
        ```
