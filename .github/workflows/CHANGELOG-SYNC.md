# Changelog Sync — operations

`changelog-sync.yml` keeps `site/src/content/changelog/**` current. It runs the
generator in `site/scripts/changelog/` (single tag on release/dispatch, backfill
on the daily cron) and opens a data-only PR via the `strands-agent` bot fork.
Release workflows also dispatch it directly after creating a GitHub release
(a `GITHUB_TOKEN`-created release does not emit a `release` event).

## CHANGELOG_BOT_TOKEN (repo secret)

A classic PAT on the **`strands-agent`** account (singular -- the dedicated bot
account, not the `strands-agents` org). Required scopes:

| Scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `public_repo` | Read releases/PRs, push branches to the bot's fork, open cross-repo PRs against this repo. |
| `workflow` | Any fork operation that carries `.github/workflows/*` changes -- both the fork `merge-upstream` sync step and PR-branch pushes -- is rejected with HTTP 422 without it. Upstream workflow files change routinely, so this scope is load-bearing, not optional. |

**When rotating the token, check both boxes.** A token with only
`public_repo` works until the next time any upstream workflow file changes,
then every scheduled run fails with:

```
refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow
`.github/workflows/changelog-sync.yml` without `workflow` scope (HTTP 422)
```

## Why a bot fork + PAT (not GITHUB_TOKEN)

PRs authored by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger `pull_request` workflows, so the
required CI Gate would never run on sync PRs. The bot is a real user account
pushing to its own fork (`strands-agent/harness-sdk`) and opening cross-repo
PRs; it has no write access to this repo.

## Recovery

- **Fork drifted / 422 on push**: the `Sync bot fork with upstream` step
  self-heals on the next run (given the `workflow` scope). Manual fix: the
  "Sync fork" button on the fork, or
  `gh api repos/strands-agent/harness-sdk/merge-upstream -f branch=main`.
- **Missed release**: dispatch `Changelog: Sync` with the release tag, or wait
  for the daily cron backstop (07:17 UTC).
- **Duplicate sync PRs** (release event vs. cron): content is identical; close
  the stale one.
